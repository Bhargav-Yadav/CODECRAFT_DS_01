# Population Data Analysis

This project analyzes population data from the World Bank.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis is the "Population, total" indicator from the World Development Indicators, obtained from the World Bank.

## Analysis Performed

1.  **Data Loading and Cleaning**: The population data is loaded from a CSV file, and initial cleaning is performed by dropping unnecessary columns.
2.  **Population Trend Analysis**: The population trend of a selected country over time is visualized using a bar chart.
3.  **Population Distribution Analysis**: The distribution of population values for the selected country is displayed using a histogram.

## How to Use

1.  Upload the `Population.csv` file to your environment.
2.  Execute the code cells sequentially to see the population analysis and visualizations.
3.  Modify the `chosen_country` variable in the code to analyze the population of a different country.

## Requirements

This analysis requires the following libraries:

-   pandas
-   matplotlib
-   numpy

These libraries are commonly available in Python environments suitable for data analysis.
